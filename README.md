Special Topic AI &amp; ML

The main objectives of this project are:

1. To perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify meaningful correlations between lifestyle habits and disease risk.
2. To design, implement, and evaluate machine learning models that predict disease risk with high accuracy.
3. To apply machine learning principles such as feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and validation techniques to ensure robust and generalizable results.
4. To interpret the models to identify which daily habits are most predictive of disease risk, offering potential real-world insights for preventive health interventions.
