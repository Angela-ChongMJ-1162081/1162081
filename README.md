This project uses the Kaggle dataset “Disease Risk from Daily Habits” to develop predictive models that assess an individual’s likelihood of developing a disease based on their lifestyle patterns. The dataset contains anonymized individual records, which likely include attributes such as dietary habits, physical activity, sleep patterns, smoking and alcohol consumption, and other daily behaviours that influence health outcomes. The target variable, representing disease presence or absence, provides the supervised learning signal for model training.

The main objectives of this project are:

1. To perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify meaningful correlations between lifestyle habits and disease risk.
2. To design, implement, and evaluate machine learning models that predict disease risk with high accuracy.
3. To apply machine learning principles such as feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and validation techniques to ensure robust and generalizable results.
4. To interpret the models to identify which daily habits are most predictive of disease risk, offering potential real-world insights for preventive health interventions.
